My notes on the task
======================

The json file was invalid, had to make it valid before I could parse it. This had me confused for some time as to why the ajax request wasn't working. The error message (lack of one!) was not helpful at all.


Used Mustache to render the cards on the page. 

Not sure whether bootstrap is being more of a hiderance? Especially for the breakpoints that don't look good for this app.
